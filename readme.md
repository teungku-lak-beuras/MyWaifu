# Hi

This is MyWaifu Android project.

The aim of this project is to hunt for waifus.

That's all.

Apart from getting big in size (caching), this project will not be getting
big at anything else, at all.

The code is aimed to be reusable.

The project files structure follows the "Now In Android" project.

I hope that this project is useful for anyone out there. Amen.

I am sorry for the lack of comments inside the code.

If you wish me to support specific waifu (or other fun) APIs, please do
not hesitate to contact me.

I cannot guarantee that I will support them, but I will seriously consider
your suggestion.

Thank you, stay healthy.
